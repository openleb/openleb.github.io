openleb.io Website
=================

[openleb.io](http://openleb.io) is a shared commons of data and tools for Lebanon made by the public for use by the public. This repository builds the front facing website.

## Contributing

Fork the repo and install the development dependences using 
```
npm install && bower install
```
The website is built using `gulp build`

## Todo
Right now the website is built using a gulpfile and pushed to the repo. For non-developers to contribute straight on github, we can investigate switching from `gulpfile build + deploy` to `Jekyll`.
