openleb.github.io
=================

This is the ront facing website for http://openleb.io

## Contributing

Fork the repo and install the development dependences using 
```
npm install && bower install
```
The website is built using `gulp build`

## Todo
Right now the website is built using a gulpfile and pushed to the repo. For non-developers to contribute straight on github, we can investigate switching from `gulpfile build + deploy` to `static layout + Markdown + JS Markdown Converters`.
